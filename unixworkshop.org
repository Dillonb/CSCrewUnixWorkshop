* A Brief History of Unix
** Multics OS project begins at MIT in 1964, released in 1969
Hugely ambitious, very influential, but had many problems and was ultimately a failure
** C programming language released in 1972
   Hugely influential early programming language
** Initial Unix release one year later, in 1973 designed around C
Unix was designed around the C programming language as a heavily simplified
alternative to Multics. Many projects have since branched off of it.
** 1985-1988 POSIX standard introduced by IEEE
Because Unix was (and is) a trademark held by AT&T, an open standard for "Unixlike" operating systems
was introduced.
** Linux released in 1991, open-source UNIX clone
Once a small personal project by Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds,
Linux is now used on 1.5% of desktop computers and 96.55% of web servers.
Google's Android and Chrome OS operating systems both run Linux at their core.
Embedded devices such as DVRs, routers, televisions, game consoles, etc often run Linux.
Linux is not certified Unix and shares no code, but functions largely the same.
** Mac OS X released in 2001, first hugely popular desktop Unix
10th release of Apple's Mac OS was the first to be based on Unix.
As of version 10.5, it has been officially certified.
* Notation Used In This Presentation
- Command run in a terminal:
** $ command
- Description of a command (command, word(s) it's derived from):
********* cmd - CoMmanD
* Getting Set Up
  - Linux and OS X
   Open a terminal
** $ ssh <netid>@zoo.uvm.edu
   - Windows
   Download PuTTY
   http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
   ... Or just google "PuTTY"
   Enter zoo.uvm.edu in the hostname field
   Hit "connect"
* The Unix Filesystem
** The root directory, /
| /bin          | System-wide binaries             |
| /dev          | Device file descriptors          |
| /etc          | System-wide configuration files  |
| /home         | User home directories            |
| /media & /mnt | External device "mount points"   |
| /opt          | Third-party applications         |
| /root         | Root user's home directory       |
| /usr          | "Userspace" applications         |
| /var          | "Variable" data, logs, databases |
* Basics and Navigation
| Command | Description/Purpose      |
| ls      | LiSt                     |
| mkdir   | MaKe DIRectory           |
| cd      | Change working Directory |
| pwd     | Print Working Directory  |
* ls - LiSt
** ls
*** Home directories
** $ ls -a
*** Command line flags
*** Hidden Files
*** . and ..
** $ ls -l
*** Permissions
* mkdir - MaKe DIRectory
** $ mkdir test
*** Command line arguments
** $ ls
** $ ls test
* cd - Change working Directory
** $ cd test
** $ cd ..
* pwd - Print Working Directory
** $ pwd
** $ cd test
** $ pwd
** $ cd
*** cd with no arguments
** $ pwd
** $ cd ~
*** ~ as an alias for home directory
* Working with Files
| Command | Description/Purpose           |
| cp      | CoPy                          |
| mv      | MoVe                          |
| rm      | ReMove                        |
| rmdir   | ReMove DIRectory              |
| cat     | conCATenate                   |
| less    | View file                     |
| head    | view HEAD of file             |
| tail    | view TAIL of file             |
| grep    | Filter data by a pattern      |
| wc      | Word Count                    |
| chmod   | Change permissions            |
| nano    | Very simple text editor       |
| vi      | Much more complex text editor |
* cp - CoPy
First, get a copy of science.txt
** $ cp /users/c/s/cscrew/science.txt .
Create a backup copy of it
** $ cp science.txt science.bak
* mv - MoVe
** $ mkdir data
** $ mv science.bak data
Moving to another directory
** $ mv data backups
Renaming files and directories
* rm - ReMove
** $ cp science.txt tempfile.txt
** $ ls
** $ rm tempfile.txt
** $ ls
* rmdir - ReMove DIRectory
** $ mkdir testdir
** $ ls
** $ rmdir testdir
** $ ls
** $ rmdir backups
Can't remove directories unless they are empty
* cat - conCATenate
** $ cat science.txt
* less - View file
** $ less science.txt
** Arrow keys or hjkl
Scroll
** :q
Quit
* head - View HEAD of file
** $ head science.txt
* tail - View TAIL of file
** $ tail science.txt
* grep - Filter data by a pattern
** Only ask why it's called grep if you REALLY want to know
** $ grep science.txt 
* wc - Word Count
** $ wc science.txt
* man - Manual
** $ man ls
*** arrow keys, q
* nano
** $ nano science.txt
* vi - Much more complex text editor
** Deserves its own workshop, only mentioning it so you know it exists
* Redirection and Pipes
| "Command" | Description/Purpose     |
| >         | Redirect output to file |
| >>        | Append output to file   |
| Â¦         |                         |
